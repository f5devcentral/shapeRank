class HyperStreams usingPlatform: p <Platform> = (
(*
A module for implementing hyperstreams. The implementation is kept as simple (naive) as possible.

A hyperstream is  either a scalar, or a stream whose elements are hyperstreams. A hyperstream has zero or more dimensions. The number of dimensions of a hyperstream is known as its rank. All elements of a hyperstream must have the same rank. Hyperstreams are represented by subclasses of HyperStream.

A scalar is itself a hyperstream,  known as a scalar hyperstream, which is represented by class ScalarHyperStream.  A scalar hyperstream has zero dimensions, and therefore has rank 0; otherwise, a hyperstream has 1 + k dimensions, where k is the rank of of its elements. Each dimension has a size, which may be known or unknown. If the size is unknown, it indicated by ?, which is represented by an instance of class UnboundedDimension; otherwise the size is a positive integer.
